# GetMotivated
<h4>Another landing page design featuring a video in the background</h4>
<p>The idea behind this project was to create a website for a platform where users could look for some inspiration and motivation (be it stories, photos, advice on how to cope with apathy, depression and etc.) and also be able to get in touch with people having similar problems, the demo is available through this <a href="https://saguanette.github.io/GetMotivated/">link</a>.</p>
<p><b>PS</b>: This project was created when I was myself going through hard times, needs to be finished</p>
